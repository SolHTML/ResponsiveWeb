    <h1>Terms of Service - SolHTML Tutoring</h1>

    <h2>Effective Date: August 13, 2025</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome, esteemed knowledge seeker, to SolHTML Tutoring (“the Platform”). By accessing or engaging with our digital sanctum of enlightenment, you (“the Learner”) hereby consent to abide by the following covenants of intellectual propriety and cybernetic decorum:
    </p>

    <h2>1. Preamble of Engagement</h2>
    <p>
        All Learners affirm that they approach this Platform solely for the purpose of academic ascension, and not for any nefarious, malicious, or otherwise pedagogically inappropriate pursuits. The Platform reserves the sovereign right to revoke access in the event of such transgressions.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Intellectual Endeavors</h2>
    <p>
        The Platform offers curated instructional materials, digital tutorials, and mind-expanding exercises. Learners acknowledge that all content is provided “as-is,” without warranty of omniscience, omnipotence, or instantaneous mastery.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Proscription of Digital Malfeasance</h2>
    <p>
        Learners shall refrain from:
        <ul>
            <li>Attempting to manipulate the Platform’s scholastic algorithms;</li>
            <li>Disseminating false knowledge under the guise of authority;</li>
            <li>Engaging in conduct that could result in cognitive dissonance among peers.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Alchemy</h2>
    <p>
        By using the Platform, Learners consent to the collection of data deemed necessary to enhance the tutoring experience. All data shall be treated with the gravitas of a scholar preserving ancient manuscripts.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Temporal Boundaries</h2>
    <p>
        The Platform may suspend or modify services at its sole discretion, including the insertion of mandatory intermissions for reflection, meditation, or snack consumption.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Exoneration of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        Under no circumstance shall the Platform be liable for:
        <ul>
            <li>Unattained grades;</li>
            <li>Involuntary bouts of existential contemplation;</li>
            <li>Any minor or major disappointment in the pursuit of knowledge.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>7. Termination of Concord</h2>
    <p>
        Either party may terminate the educational engagement at any time, though the Platform reserves the right to retain memories of the interaction in encrypted digital scrolls.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Miscellanea</h2>
    <p>
        The Platform’s Terms of Service are governed by the eternal laws of logic, the unassailable principles of curiosity, and applicable terrestrial statutes. By continuing, the Learner acknowledges comprehension, agreement, and a willingness to embrace erudition.
